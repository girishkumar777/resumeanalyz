# 🚀 AI Resume Analyzer



---

## ✨ Introduction

This is an **AI-powered Resume Analyzer** that I built by following a YouTube tutorial and coding along step-by-step.
The goal of the project was to learn how to combine modern frontend tools with AI integrations to build something practical and useful.

With this app, you can:

* Upload and store resumes
* Get **ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores**
* Receive personalized **feedback** tailored to job descriptions
* Use a clean, reusable **React + Tailwind UI**

It was a great hands-on learning experience that helped me improve my React, TypeScript, and state management skills.

* **React Router v7** – for routing and navigation
